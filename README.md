# üõ°Ô∏è Malicious IP Blocker Automator (Python + UFW)

This project automates a basic **Incident Response (IR)** containment task on **Linux Mint/Ubuntu** environments. It reads a list of malicious IP addresses from a text file and automatically blocks them using the system's firewall, **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall).

## üõ†Ô∏è Demonstrated Skills

* **Python:** File handling, **List Comprehension**, and utilizing the `subprocess` library to execute system commands.
* **Linux/UFW:** Interaction with the **UFW** firewall for security configuration.
* **SOC Function:** Automation of repetitive **Incident Response (IR)** and containment tasks.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone** this repository to your Linux Mint machine.
2.  **Populate** the `malicious_ips.txt` file with the list of IP addresses you wish to block (one IP per line).
3.  **Execute** the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ip_blocker.py  # Give execution permission (optional but recommended)
    ./ip_blocker.py
    ```
    *Note: The script requires your administrator password because it uses the `sudo` command internally to modify the UFW rules.*
